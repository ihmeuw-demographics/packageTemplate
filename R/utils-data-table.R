# data.table is generally careful to minimize the scope for namespace
# conflicts (i.e., functions with the same name as in other packages);
# a more conservative approach using @importFrom should be careful to
# import any needed data.table special symbols as well, e.g., if you
# run DT[ , .N, by='grp'] in your package, you'll need to add
# @importFrom data.table .N to prevent the NOTE from R CMD check.
# See ?data.table::`special-symbols` for the list of such symbols
# data.table defines; see the 'Importing data.table' vignette for more
# advice (vignette('datatable-importing', 'data.table')).
#

NULL

# this is needed for non-standard evaluation in data.table (and some other
# packages). Multiple links suggest using `utils::globalVariables` to remove
# notes when checking the package.
